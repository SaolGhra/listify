Listify is a simple todolist web application that allows you to add, save, and remember tasks, dates, and descriptions. It is built using vanilla JavaScript and does not require any external modules. Instead, it utilizes custom-made cookies within the user's browser to store the task data.

## Features

- Add tasks: Easily add new tasks to your todolist.
- Set dates: Assign due dates to your tasks for better organization.
- Add descriptions: Include detailed descriptions for each task.
- Save tasks: The application automatically saves your tasks using custom-made cookies.
- Remember tasks: Even if you close the browser, your tasks will be remembered when you return.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Use the input fields to add new tasks, set dates, and add descriptions.
4. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to your todolist.
5. Your tasks will be saved automatically using custom-made cookies.
6. To view or modify existing tasks, simply reload the page.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of Listify by porting it to mobile platforms and implementing local storage for data persistence. This will allow users to access their tasks and manage their todo lists on the go, without the need for an internet connection. By utilizing local storage, the app will be able to store task data directly on the user's device, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. Stay tuned for updates on these exciting developments!
